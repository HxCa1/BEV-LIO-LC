# Why Choose MCD, NCD, and M2DGR Datasets?

### ðŸš« Limitations of Common Datasets (KITTI, MulRan, Oxford RobotCar)

1. **Sensor Compatibility**:  
   - KITTI lacks good IMU data, which is critical for tightly-coupled LIO methods.  
2. **Overfitting Concerns**:  
   - Existing algorithms have become over-optimized on datasets like MulRan and Oxford RobotCar, leaving limited room for meaningful comparison or breakthroughs in performance.
3. **Ground Truth Accuracy**:  
   - Large-scale environments in these datasets may have unreliable ground truth, affecting evaluation validity.

### âœ… Advantages of MCD, NCD, and M2DGR

1. **Diverse Environments**:  
   - Include varied scenarios and sensor configurations.  
2. **Real-World Relevance**:  
   - MCD's ATV and M2DGR's ground robot align with practical robotics use cases.  
3. **Robust Evaluation**:  
   - Provide challenging conditions to validate method robustness.
